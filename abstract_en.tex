\chapter{Abstract}
We have demonstrated spread spectrum technology at the single photon level, which are generated from cavity enhanced SPDC. In our experiment, we have used synchronized high-speed electro-optic modulators to modulate the phase of single photon and biphoton wave packets, broadening the spectrum from 4.5 MHz to 10 GHz for avoiding on-resonant photons being absorb or detected by the atoms. Which is like imposing an invisible cloak over a photon, improving the confidentiality during the transmission process in order to improve the security of quantum communication and key distribution.
