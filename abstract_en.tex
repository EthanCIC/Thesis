\chapter{Abstract}
We use spread spectrum technology at the single photon level in order to improve the security of quantum communication and key distribution. In our experiment, we use high-speed electro-optic modulators to modulate the phase of single photon and biphoton wave packet, brodening the spectrum from 4.5 MHz to 10 GHz, to avoid photons being absorbed or detected by the atoms which is on the same energy level as the photon. It's like puting a invisible cloak over a photon, improving the confidentiality during the transmission process.
